## Setup
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# packages
library(tidyverse)

# longline data
longline_full <- read.csv("/Users/cristiana/Documents/R/GeospatialR/Practice Data/drifting_longlines_small/Sheet 1-Table 1.csv")
```

## Data exploration
```{r cars}
str(longline_full)
head(longline_full)

# how many individual vessels are included in this dataset
unique(longline_full$mmsi)
class(longline_full$mmsi)
longline_full$mmsi <- as.factor(longline_full$mmsi)
# there are two vessels in this dataset
# how many records (location points) does each vessel have
nrow(longline_full)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
